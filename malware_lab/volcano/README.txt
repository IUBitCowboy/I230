My dad is so lame. He has to have this complicated daemon in his home directory:
/usr/local/games/dr_evil

He just wants to collect information about who is logged into the system over time.
I'm like just put an entry in the cron file /etc/crontrab and BOOM! you're done. But no, he has to go 
make it all complicated as usual. He even tries to hide his plans in his home directory.
