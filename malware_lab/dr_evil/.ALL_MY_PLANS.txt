ALL MY PLANS

I have created a diabolical daemon process to log who is logged into the system over time. The 
information is in a log format that can be read on the web server running on the system. The URL is 
http://localhost:4566/evil.log

The daemon is started on each reboot using the . The file /etc/init.d/evil launches
the daemon when th system reboots. 

In addition, my daemon will periodically create additional accounts for my henchmen. My henchmen
have a ssh private key that allows them to securely login to the system. 

Scott thinks his idea with the /etc/.volcano_lair is so good.

Austin Powers and his associates will never discover these plans!
